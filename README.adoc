# Asteroids Game

## Project Goal
Develop a game inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)[Asteroids] using the https://macroquad.rs/[Macroquad] library.

## About
- Project developed with https://github.com/Lyndakhazem[Lynda KHAZEM] as part of the ProgEfficace (IN512) course in the third year of the Computer Science license program at UVSQ.
- Managed with https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/[Cargo].
- The `main.rs` file handles rendering and interactions.
- Game objects (spaceship, asteroids, missiles) are managed in separate modules.

## Game Features
- Round objects to simplify collision handling.
- Asteroids move at a constant, randomly determined speed.
- The spaceship is controlled by the player with inertia and shield management.
- Screen looping: exiting one side re-enters on the opposite side.
- Missiles destroy or split asteroids.
- End conditions:
  - Defeat if the spaceship is destroyed.
  - Victory if all asteroids are eliminated.
  - Quit by pressing `Escape`.

## Development Phases
1. **Asteroid Management**: multiple asteroids, different sizes, splitting upon collision.
2. **Spaceship Addition**: rendering, keyboard controls with arrow keys, collision management.
3. **Missile Implementation**: shooting (`Space`), rendering, asteroid collision handling.
4. **Optimization and Refactoring**: creating a `StellarObject` https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html[trait] to unify common behaviors.
